The location changes every week, the best way to keep up to date on the location is through a dynamic ics file. \r\n\r\n## Instructions\r\nCopy and paste the following link into your calendar's \"subscription\" functionality **rather than downloading the static file**:\r\n\r\n `https://calendar.google.com/calendar/ical/ho60q57pauegr2ki4v9hhspvdo%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic.ics`\r\n\r\nNow your calendar software should be up to date. If you see the same location every week, you've probably accidentally downloaded the static ics. You'll need to try again.",
